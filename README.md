BLThunderstorm is an **unofficial** dashboard and stats-tracking site for Battlelog games.

BLThunderstorm is still work in progress and not production-ready.

## Why the name?
'BLThunderstorm' is just a codename. I haven't thought of a great name for this project yet.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
